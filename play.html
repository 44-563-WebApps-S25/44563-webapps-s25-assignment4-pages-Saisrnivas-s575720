    <p class = "speech Duchess">Why droops my lord, like over-ripen'd corn,
        Hanging the head at Ceres' plenteous load?
        Why doth the great Duke Humphrey knit his brows,
        As frowning at the favours of the world?
        Why are thine eyes fixed to the sullen earth,
        Gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight?
        What seest thou there? King Henry's diadem,
        Enchased with all the honours of the world?
        If so, gaze on, and grovel on thy face,
        Until thy head be circled with the same.
        Put forth thy hand, reach at the glorious gold.
        What, is't too short? I'll lengthen it with mine:
        And, having both together heaved it up,
        We'll both together lift our heads to heaven,
        And never more abase our sight so low
        As to vouchsafe one glance unto the ground.

    <p class = "speech Duchess">Tut, this was nothing but an argument
        That he that breaks a stick of Gloucester's grove
        Shall lose his head for his presumption.
        But list to me, my Humphrey, my sweet duke:
        Methought I sat in seat of majesty
        In the cathedral church of Westminster,
        And in that chair where kings and queens are crown'd;
        Where Henry and dame Margaret kneel'd to me
        And on my head did set the diadem.</p>

        Presumptuous dame, ill-nurtured Eleanor,
        Art thou not second woman in the realm,
        And the protector's wife, beloved of him?
        Hast thou not worldly pleasure at command,
        Above the reach or compass of thy thought?
        And wilt thou still be hammering treachery,
        To tumble down thy husband and thyself
        From top of honour to disgrace's feet?
        Away from me, and let me hear no more!.</p>

        Exeunt GLOUCESTER and Messenger<br>
        
        Follow I must; I cannot go before,
        While Gloucester bears this base and humble mind.
        Were I a man, a duke, and next of blood,
        I would remove these tedious stumbling-blocks
        And smooth my way upon their headless necks;
        And, being a woman, I will not be slack
        To play my part in Fortune's pageant.
        Where are you there? Sir John! nay, fear not, man,
        We are alone; here's none but thee and I.
